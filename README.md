# Project US Bikes411
This Web Application allows the user to access bike incident reports across the United States. This application also reveal the coordinates at which each incident was reported.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery ,Ajax, & API Documentation

To develop the *Project US Bikes411*  web application I used the Ajax technique to interact with two public APIs. For each object I display the value for the type of incident occurring across the entire country and the latitude and longitude for the location of each reported incident.

For the second Ajax technique I used an API with random images of dogs.

## Lessons Learned:

While developing this web application I learned how to access multiple properties of an object. I also tied one event listener to two Ajax requests, allowing me to append data retrieved from multiple objects and append them to the DOM.
